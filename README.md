# Ultrasonic_Radar

Radar is a detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. 

In this project we are using Ultrasonic waves to make this project.

components used:-
1) Arduino Uno/Mega
2) Servo Motor
3) jumper wires

the codes for this project is along with this file.

here we are using two files.
1) one arduino file which code of which is first dumped into arduino..

2) procesing 3.0 file which is used for the graphical display interface.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The serial port wire is used to connect arduino and the computer. This wire is used to transmit and recieve data from arduino. 
  After dumping the arduino code into the arduino, open the processing 3.0 file and run it. the port receives the data from arduino and processing processes it to give a graphical display.
